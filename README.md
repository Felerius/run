# run

A module for running experiments that involve the execution of
commands with different combinations of command line arguments.

We recommend to first check out the
[documentation](https://thobl.github.io/run/) that explains everything
with a bunch of examples.  For quick lookup, also see the [reference
documentation](https://thobl.github.io/run/run.html).
